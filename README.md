# Pong-Pokemon-NX
A pong game for Nintendo Switch with Pokemon as main theme.

Note: You will have to launch this homebrew via launching a game holding R as launching it via the Album or the homebrew launcher as nsp won't work. Otherwise, you can make a forward of the app at https://nsp-forwarder.n8.io/. I personnaly use 01daced5c3300000 as ID and the 'NRO Path' should be 'switch/Pong_Pokemon_NX.nro'.

Three modes available :

1 - Player vs Player

2 - Player vs Wall

3 - Player vs AI

Here are some captures :
